PDK4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4) regulates pyruvate oxidation through the phosphorylation and inhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and is an important control point in glucose and pyruvate metabolism. PDK4 gene expression is stimulated by thyroid hormone (T(3)), glucocorticoids, and long chain fatty acids. The effects of T(3) on gene expression in the liver are mediated via the thyroid hormone receptor. Here, we have identified two binding sites for thyroid hormone receptor beta in the promoter of the rat PDK4 (rPDK4) gene. In addition, we have investigated the role of transcriptional coactivators and found that the PGC-1 alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator) enhances the T(3) induction of rPDK4. Following T(3) administration, there is an increase in the association of PGC-1 alpha with the rPDK4 promoter. Interestingly, this increased association is with the proximal rPDK4 promoter rather than the distal region of the gene that contains the T(3) response elements. Administration of T(3) to hypothyroid rats elevated the abundance of PGC-1 alpha mRNA and protein in the liver. In addition, we observed greater association of PGC-1 alpha not only with the rPDK4 gene but also with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and CPT-1a (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a) genes. Knockdown of PGC-1 alpha in rat hepatocytes reduced the T(3) induction of PDK4, PEPCK, and CPT-1a genes. Our results indicate that T(3) regulates PGC-1 alpha abundance and association with hepatic genes, and in turn PGC-1 alpha is an important participant in the T(3) induction of selected genes.
