Interest in the topic of tumour metabolism has waxed and waned over the past century of cancer research. The early observations of Warburg and his contemporaries established that there are fundamental differences in the central metabolic pathways operating in malignant tissue. However, the initial hypotheses that were based on these observations proved inadequate to explain tumorigenesis, and the oncogene revolution pushed tumour metabolism to the margins of cancer research. In recent years, interest has been renewed as it has become clear that many of the signalling pathways that are affected by genetic mutations and the tumour microenvironment have a profound effect on core metabolism, making this topic once again one of the most intense areas of research in cancer biology.
