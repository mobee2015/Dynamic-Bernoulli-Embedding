In C4 plants, the pyruvate phosphate dikinase regulatory protein (PDRP) regulates the C4-pathway enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) in response to changes in incident light-intensity. In maize (Zea mays) leaves, two distinct isoforms of PDRP are expressed, ZmPDRP1 and ZmPDRP2. The properties and C4-function of ZmPDRP1 isoform are well understood. However, the PDRP2 isoform has only recently been identified and its properties and function(s) in maize leaves are unknown. We therefore initiated an investigation into the maize PDRP2 isoform by performing a side-by-side comparison of its enzyme properties and cell-specific distribution with PDRP1. In terms of enzyme functionality, PDRP2 was found to possess the same protein kinase specific-activity as PDRP1. However, the PDRP2 isoform was found to lack the phosphotransferase activity of the bifunctional PDRP1 isoform except when PDRP2 in the assays is elevated to 5- to 10-fold. A primarily immuno-based approach was used to show that PDRP1 is strictly expressed in mesophyll-cells and PDRP2 is strictly expressed in bundle-sheath strand cells (BSC). Additionally, using in situ immunolocalization, we establish a regulatory target for PDRP2 by showing a significant presence of C4-PPDK in BSC chloroplasts. However, a metabolic role for PPDK in this compartment is obscure assuming PPDK accumulating in this compartment would be irreversibly inactivated each dark cycle by a monofunctional PDRP2.
