Orexins are hypothalamic neuropeptides that regulate food intake, energy homeostasis, reward system and sleep/wakefulness states. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of orexin A on glucose metabolism in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, Hep3B, and determine the possible mechanisms. Hep3B cells were incubated with different concentrations of orexin A (10(-9)-10(-7) M) in vitro in the presence or absence of the orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) inhibitor (SB334867), Akt inhibitor (PF-04691502) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor (temsirolimus). Subsequently, OX1R protein expression, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression, glucose uptake, the mRNA expression of lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase B (PDHB), lactate generation and mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) enzyme activity were measured. The activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling was also determined. OX1R was expressed in hepatoma tissues and Hep3B cells. Stimulation of the Hep3B cells with orexin A resulted in a dose-dependent increase of GLUT1 expression and glucose uptake, which was associated with the activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Further, orexin A increased PDHB expression and PDH enzyme activity, decreased LDHA, PDK1 mRNA levels and lactate generation independent of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Our results demonstrated that orexin A directed the cellular metabolism towards mitochondrial glucose oxidation rather than glycolysis. These findings provide functional evidence of the metabolic actions of orexin A in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
