Viruses have evolved sophisticated strategies to exploit host cell function for their benefit. Here we show that under physiologically normal oxygen levels (normoxia) vaccinia virus (VACV) infection leads to a rapid stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, its translocation into the nucleus and the activation of HIF-responsive genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter-1, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1. HIF-1alpha stabilization is mediated by VACV protein C16 that binds the human oxygen sensing enzyme prolyl-hydroxylase domain containing protein (PHD)2 and thereby inhibits PHD2-dependent hydroxylation of HIF-1alpha. The binding between C16 and PHD2 is direct and specific, and ectopic expression of C16 alone induces transcription of HIF-1alpha responsive genes. Conversely, a VACV strain lacking the gene for C16, C16L, is unable to induce HIF-1alpha stabilization. Interestingly, the N-terminal region of C16 is predicted to have a PHD2-like structural fold but lacks the catalytic active site residues of PHDs. The induction of a hypoxic response by VACV is reminiscent of the biochemical consequences of solid tumor formation, and illustrates a poxvirus strategy for manipulation of cellular gene expression and biochemistry.
