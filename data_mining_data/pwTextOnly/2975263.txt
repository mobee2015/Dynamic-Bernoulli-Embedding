The activities of enzymes of the glycolytic route, the pentose phosphate pathway and NADPH-linked enzymes have been measured in the kidneys of genetically obese (ob/ob) mice and their lean litter mates. The renal content of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (Fru-1,6-P2) and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) were also measured. Increases were found in hexokinase and enolase with an upward trend in pyruvate kinase in the ob/ob mouse kidney; a significant decline in malic enzyme was also seen. The renal content of G6P and Fru-1,6-P2 increased. There was no renal hypertrophy despite a degree of hyperglycaemia, which was, however, considerably below that observed in experimental diabetes. Comparison of the renal changes in the hyperglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic ob/ob mice with the hyperglycaemic-hypoinsulinaemic diabetic group showed two distinct groupings. Firstly, changes which were similar in the two groups included: increases in hexokinase, G6P and Fru-1,6-P2, and a decrease in malic enzyme. Secondly, opposite changes were seen in enolase and in enzymes at the G6P crossroads, phosphoglucose isomerase and phosphoglucomutase. The elevated hexokinase and G6P in both ob/ob and diabetic groups may be involved in the eventual accumulation of basement membrane material in the glomerulus which is a common feature of the two conditions.
