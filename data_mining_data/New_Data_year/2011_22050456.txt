In this present work, we characterized the proteomes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell line PANC-1 and normal pancreatic duct cells by mass spectrometry using LTQ-Orbitrap and identified more than 1700 proteins from each sample. On the basis of the spectra count label-free quantification approach, we identified a large number of differentially expressed metabolic enzymes and proteins involved in cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, transport, transcription, translation, and cell proliferation as well. The data demonstrated that metabolic pathways were altered in PANC-1, consistent with the Warburg effect. In addition, the comparative MS analysis unveiled anomalous metabolism of glutamine, suggesting that glutamine was largely consumed as a nitrogen donor in nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis in PANC-1. Our analysis provides a potentially comprehensive picture of metabolism in PANC-1, which may serve as the basis of new diagnostics and treatment of PDAC.
