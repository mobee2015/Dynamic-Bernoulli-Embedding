A series of 2-anilino substituted 4-aryl-8H-purines were prepared as potent inhibitors of PDK1, a serine-threonine kinase thought to play a role in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, a key mediator of cancer cell growth, survival and tumorigenesis. The synthesis, SAR and ADME properties of this series of compounds are discussed culminating in the discovery of compound 6 which possessed sub-micromolar cell proliferation activity and 65% oral bioavailability in mice.
