MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), a highly abundant and liver-specific miRNA, acts as a tumor suppressor against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Decreased expression of miR-122 in HCC is frequently observed and is associated with poor differentiation, larger tumor size, metastasis and invasion, and poor prognosis. Mutant mice with knockout (KO) of the miR-122 locus developed steatohepatitis due to increased triglyceride (TG) synthesis and decreased TG secretion from hepatocytes, and eventually developed HCC. Exogenic miR-122 introduction into miR-122 KO mice inhibited the development of HCC. Target genes of miR-122, including cyclin G1, a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)10, serum response factor, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, ADAM17, transcription factor CUTL1, the embryonic isoform of pyruvate kinase (Pkm2), Wnt1, pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 binding factor, Cut-like homeobox 1, and c-myc, are involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and angiogenesis. MiR-122 expression is regulated by liver-enriched transcription factors such as hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)1alpha, HNF3beta, HNF4alpha, HNF6, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha. A positive feedback loop exists between C/EBPalpha and miR-122 and between HNF6 and miR-122, whereas a negative feedback loop exists between c-myc and miR-122. Since cotreatment of 5-Aza-Cd and histone deacetylase inhibitor restored miR-122 expression in HCC cells, epigenetic modulation of miR-122 expression is involved in the suppression of miR-122 in HCC. Several experiments suggest that increasing miR-122 levels in HCC with or without antitumor agents may be a promising strategy for HCC treatment.
