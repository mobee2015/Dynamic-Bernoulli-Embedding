Hepatocellular steatosis constitutes the most frequent liver disease in western countries and may progress to steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The lipid droplet (LD)-associated proteins perilipin, adipophilin, TIP47 ("tail interacting protein of 47 kDa"), S3-12 and myocardial LD protein (MLDP), so-called perilipins 1-5 (PAT family) govern formation, maintenance and degradation of LDs. A lack of perilipin in mice inhibits obesity and a lack of adipophilin or TIP47 inhibit the development of fatty liver disease. In long-term cell culture models as well as in liver biopsies of patients with different acute and chronic liver diseases, LD-associated proteins are sequentially recruited to LDs and regulated via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha and PPARgamma as well as posttranscriptionally via alternative splicing, LD fusion and lipolysis. Whereas TIP47 and MLDP coat small newly formed LDs in acute microvesicular steatosis, adipophilin constitutes a robust general marker for LDs in many different cell types. Perilipin is important for the long-term storage of lipids in macrovesicular steatosis and controls lipolysis via hormone-dependent phosphorylation. During malignant transformation, increased formation of small LDs and overexpression of adipophilin, TIP47 and MLDP are detected, possibly as the expression of an altered tumor metabolism analogous to a Warburg effect. Adipophilin correlates positively with the proliferation rate of HCC cells. Cultured cells with downregulation of TIP47 or adipophilin via small interfering RNA (siRNA) or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) show less but larger LDs with reduced neutral fat content.
