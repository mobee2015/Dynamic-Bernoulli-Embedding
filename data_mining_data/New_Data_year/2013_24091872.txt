Beyond its role in recycling intracellular components nonselectively to sustain survival in response to metabolic stresses, autophagy can also selectively degrade specific cargoes such as damaged or dysfunctional organelles to maintain cellular homeostasis. Mitochondria, known as the power plant of cells, are the critical and dynamic organelles playing a fundamental role in cellular metabolism. Mitophagy, the selective autophagic elimination of mitochondria, has been identified both in yeast and in mammalian cells. Moreover, defects in mitophagy may contribute to a variety of human disorders such as neurodegeneration and myopathies. However, the role of mitophagy in development and cancer remains largely unclear. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of the regulation and function of mitophagy in development and cancer.
