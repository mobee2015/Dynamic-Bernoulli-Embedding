To achieve the liver-directed expression in sufficient amounts of therapeutic genes for successful and safe gene therapy, natural liver-specific promoters can be used to direct the expression of therapeutic genes in the liver, whereas strong viral enhancers were used to obtain sufficient amounts of expressed therapeutic gene products. However, very often use of either the former or the latter does not guarantee both potent and liver-specific therapeutic gene expression. Here we conglomerate them and thus create a potent tissue-specific promoter by characterizing and using the liver-type pyruvate kinase proximal promoter (LPKPP) harboring its TATA box and a HNF-1alpha binding site. Alone it hardly activated its reporter gene expression in non-hepatocytes or hepatocytes. However, in the presence of the SV40 viral enhancer (SV40VE), which is active in multiple cell types, it was able to potently activate its reporter gene expression specifically in hepatocytes. The tissue-specific activation of the LPKPP by the viral enhancer was attributed to HNF-1alpha binding to the LPKPP. Taken together, these results support the idea that the constitutively active SV40VE could be used to activate the LPKPP in a tissue-specific manner in the presence of HNF-1alpha. To our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize HNF-1alpha and its binding site, in the context of the LPKPP, to generate a basal promoter that is transcriptionally activated potently in a tissue-specific manner by a viral enhancer that is active in multiple cell types.
