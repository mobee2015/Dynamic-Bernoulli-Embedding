OBJECTIVE: To investigate the enhancement effect of the combination of shRNA interfering plasmid targeting PKM2 with recombinant Endostatin in the treatment of lung cancer. METHODS: Twenty five BABL/nu/nu mice bearing A549 lung cancer were divided into 5 groups (NS control, psh-Control, psh-PKM2 treated group, Endostar treated group, psh-PKM2+Endostar treated group) and treated with shRNA interfering plasmid targeting PKM2 and recombinant Endostatin respectively or in combination. The expression of PKM2 in A549 detected with immunofluorescent assay. The interference effect of psh-PKM2 was determined by Western blot. The tumor volume, microvessel density (MVD), apoptosis index (AI) and side effects were observed. RESULTS: The combination treatment of RNA interfering plasmid targeting PKM2 with recombinant Endostatin inhibited tumor growth obviously (P < 0.05); The combination group revealed a decreased MVD and an increased AI (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of shRNA interfering plasmid targeting PKM2 with recombinant Endostatin might enhance anti-tumor effect by increasing the apoptosis of the cancer cell.
