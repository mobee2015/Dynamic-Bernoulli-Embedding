BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of the most serious form of malaria, infects about 5-10% of the world human population per year. It is well established that the erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite rely mainly on glycolysis for their energy supply. In the present study, the glucose utilisation of erythrocyte population with parasitaemia levels similar to that of malaria patients was measured. The results allowed us to assess the effect of the parasites on the glucose utilisation of the vast majority of uninfected erythrocytes. METHODS: Using [2-13C]glucose and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique, the glucose utilisation in normal red blood cell (RBC) and P. falciparum infected red blood cell (IRBC) populations was measured. The IRBC population consisted of > 96% RBC and < 4% of parasite infected red blood cells (PRBC). The glycolytic enzymes were assayed to assess the effect of infected red cells on the enzymatic activities of uninfected ones. RESULTS: The rate of glucose utilisation by IRBC was considerably higher than that of RBC. Upon addition of 25% v/v conditioned culture medium (CM) of IRBC, RBCs exhibited a significant decrease in glucose utilisation. The CM could directly inhibit the activities of RBC glycolytic enzymes-phosphofructokinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), without interfering with the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway enzyme-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD). INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The present study showed that the clinical level of P. falciparum infected RBCs (< 4% parasitaemia) significantly enhance the glycolytic flux as well as down-regulate the glucose utilisation rate in the majority of uninfected RBC population. The mechanism of inhibition seems to be direct inhibition of the regulatory glycolytic enzymes-PFK and PK.
